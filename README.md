👋 I am Thibault, I like to make interesting / fun / useful things that render in a browser. 

I am doing this since 10 years as a Freelancer, and I am currently available for contract work.

Some things I made:

- https://beatthetraffic.app : A fun game around urban mobility 📱.
- https://maps3d.io : An tool to create 3D maps 🗺️ from open data.
- https://pregonerosdemedellin.com : An interactive webdocumentary 🎥 about street vendors in Colombia  [making of blog post](https://medium.com/@tibbb/how-we-created-an-immersive-street-walk-experience-with-a-gopro-and-javascript-f442cf8aa2dd#.9k0cqaro5)
